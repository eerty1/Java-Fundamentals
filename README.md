# Java-fundamentals

This is an initial step of my Java acquaintance. 	:relaxed:

On the basis of EPAM lectures, I managed to study rudimental Java functions, get used to the syntax and 
understand  how it works in general. :technologist:

When finishing the course of lectures, I was to complete the main task containing 5 assignments. :man_student:

Also I had a possibility to strengthen my skills by completing several optional tasks for self studying. :muscle:

All the tasks requirements are provided in EPAM repository (the link you can find in "other" below in document). :eye:

The number after "Optional Task" indicates the task number from the backup

In this repository you will find these tasks done according to my first impression of Java. 	

## Installation

Since it is pure Java, you needn't any complicated actions. :trophy:

You are proposed to use Java 8.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Java-fundamentals

* Open it via your IDE

## Usage

There're no any peculiarities.

As I said before, just open it in your IDE and build the project.

## Other
 
All the materials were taken from the [EPAM Automated Testing course](https://training.epam.com/#!/Training/3044?lang=en). :test_tube:

The backup of the tasks could be found [there](https://github.com/vitalliuss/automation-training.git), in file "backup.md". :file_folder:

Unfortunately they provided only RU verion of the requirements.
